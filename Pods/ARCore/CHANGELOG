Version 1.4.0 (2018-08)
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  - Fixed an issue where hosting and resolving cloud anchors would fail on iOS
    12 with the new 4:3 aspect ratio.

Version 1.3.0 (2018-06-21)
==========================
Adds support for ARKit-compatible iPads. These include:
  - iPad: 5th and 6th generation
  - iPad Pro: 12.9 inch (1st and 2nd gen), 10.5 inch, 9.7 inch

Resolved Issues:
  - Fixed an issue where an invalid API key for the ARCore Cloud Anchor Service
    would result in a cloud anchor state of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorInternal`.
    The error state will now be `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorNotAuthorized`.

Version 1.2.1 (2018-05-30)
==========================
Resolved Issues:
  - Removed SDK references to `ARFaceAnchor`. The `hostCloudAnchor:`
    implementation no longer checks that the passed in `ARAnchor` is not an
    `ARFaceAnchor`, and no longer forcibly exits with
    `GARSessionErrorCodeAnchorNotSupportedForHosting`. However, use of
    `ARFaceAnchor`s remains unsupported in this release.

Version 1.2.0 (2018-05-08)
==========================
Initial release alongside ARCore 1.2 on Android.
- Support for Cloud Anchors.
- Supported devices: iPhone X, 8, 8+, 7, 7+, 6S, 6S+, SE.

Known Issues:
  - An invalid API key for the ARCore Cloud Anchor Service will result in a
    Cloud Anchor state of `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorInternal` instead of
    `GARCloudAnchorStateErrorNotAuthorized`. This is a known issue and will be
    fixed in an upcoming release.
